DNS plays a critical part of almost every aspect of your Internet experience. Every time you visit a website, send an e-mail, or do almost anything on the Internet, DNS is there to help you get to the right place. DNS security is important because it links the domain name to the IP. Internet criminals can exploit these weaknesses and are capable of creating false DNS records. These fake records can trick users into visiting _`fake websites, downloading malicious software, or worse`_. Unlike the DNS servers from your  ISP, custom DNS(Cloudflare/OpenDns/GoogleDns.etc) servers store the IP addresses of millions of websites in their cache so it would take less time to resolve your requests. Another huge advantage of using a custom DNS is that it blocks phishing websites from loading on your computer.
